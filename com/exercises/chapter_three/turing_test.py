# 3.6 (Turing Test) The great British mathematician Alan Turing proposed a simple test
# to determine whether machines could exhibit intelligent behavior. A user sits at a computer
# and does the same text chat with a human sitting at a computer and a computer operating by itself.
# The user doesn’t know if the responses are coming back from the human or the independent computer.
# If the user can’t distinguish which responses are coming from the human and which are coming from the
# computer, then it’s reasonable to say that the computer is exhibiting intelligence.
# Create a script that plays the part of the independent computer, giving its user a simple medical
# diagnosis. The script should prompt the user with 'What is your problem?'.
# When the user answers and presses Enter, the script should simply ignore the user’s input,
# then prompt the user again with 'Have you had this problem before (yes or no)?' If
# the user enters 'yes', print 'Well, you have it again.' If the user answers 'no', print
# 'Well, you have it now.'
# Would this conversation convince the user that the entity at the other end exhibited
# intelligent behavior? Why or why not?

first_statement = input('What is your problem?')
second_statement = input('Have you had this problem before (yes or no)?')

if second_statement == 'yes':
    print('Well, you have it again.')
elif second_statement == 'no':
    print('Well, you have it now.')
else:
    print('Simple question, yes or no?')
