# 3.1 (Validating User Input) Modify the script of Fig. 3.3 to validate its inputs. For any
# input, if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping until the user enters a correct
# value. Use one counter to keep track of the number of passes, then calculate the number
# of failures after all the userâ€™s inputs have been received.

# initialize variables
passes = 0  # number of passes
failures = 0  # number of failures

# process 10 students
for student in range(10):
    # get one exam result
    result = int(input('Enter result (1=pass, 2=fail): '))

    if result == 1:
        passes = passes + 1
    elif result == 2:
        failures = failures + 1
    else:
        result = int(input('Enter result (1=pass, 2=fail): '))
        if result == 1:
            passes = passes + 1
        else:
            failures = failures + 1
# termination phase
print('Passed:', passes)
print('Failed:', failures)

if passes > 8:
    print('Bonus to instructor')
