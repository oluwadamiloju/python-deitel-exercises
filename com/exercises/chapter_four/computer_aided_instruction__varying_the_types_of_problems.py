# 4.17 (Computer-Assisted Instruction: Varying the Types of Problems) Modify the previous exercise to
# allow the user to pick a type of arithmetic problem to study â€” 1 means addition problems only, 2 means
# subtraction problems only, 3 means multiplication problems only, 4 means division problems only
# (avoid dividing by 0) and 5 means a random mixture of all these types.
