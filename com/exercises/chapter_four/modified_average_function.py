# 4.6 (Modified average Function) The average function we defined in Section 4.11 can receive any
# number of arguments. If you call it with no arguments, however, the function causes a ZeroDivisionError.
# Reimplement average to receive one required argument and the arbitrary argument list argument *args,
# and update its calculation accordingly. Test your function. The function will always require at least
# one argument, so youâ€™ll no longer be able to get a ZeroDivisionError. When you call average with no
# arguments, Python should issue a TypeError indicating "average() missing 1 required  positional argument."


def average(number, *args):
    return (number + sum(args)) / (1 + len(args))


# print(average())
print(average(3, 3, 5, 8))
