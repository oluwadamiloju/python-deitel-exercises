# 4.14 (Computer-Assisted Instruction) Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) refers to the use of computers
# in education. Write a script to help an elementary school student learn multiplication. Create a
# function that randomly generates and returns a tuple of two positive one-digit integers. Use that
# functionâ€™s result in your script to prompt the user with a question, such as
#                 How much is 6 times 7?
# For a correct answer, display the message "Very good!" and ask another multiplication question. For an
# incorrect answer, display the message "No. Please try again." and let the student try the same question
# repeatedly until the student finally gets it right.
